                        <p>
                            My journey in web development began during my college years when I discovered my passion for coding and building interactive websites. I was captivated by the ability to combine creativity with technical skills to bring ideas to life in the digital world. Since then, I have immersed myself in the ever-evolving field of web development, constantly learning and honing my skills to stay at the forefront of the industry.

                        <p>
                            Over the years, I have developed expertise in a wide range of web development technologies. I am proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the foundation of every modern website. I have hands-on experience with popular front-end frameworks like React and Angular, allowing me to build dynamic and responsive user interfaces. Additionally, I am adept at back-end technologies such as Node.js and PHP, and I have worked with various databases like MySQL and MongoDB.
